# negative_training_sampler Changelog

## development

* rename genome_file to reference-file
* use a genome file of the fasta for the contigs by `--genome-file` (see #7) to avoid hard-coded contigs. Now this sampler should work with every species.


## v0.1.0

Initial negative_training_sampler version.
